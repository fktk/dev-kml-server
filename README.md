8. Push the feature's name you edited on Google Earth. Then camera view will be updated.

That's enough for my use caseðŸ˜Š

## Note about "Trustworthy Authority"

On first load, your browser will warn you that the certificate does not come from a trusted authority.
This is good, because live-server is not a trusted certification authority.
Depending on your browser, you will need to either 'unsafely proceed' or add an exception,
both of which are usually under an advanced options in the prompt.
